        <p> I made my first trip to Ladakh in 2008. It was followed by multiple trips over the years. My love affair with this most fantastic trans-Himalayan region in India continues, and I plan to make many more trips. </p>
        <p> This book is a collection of photographs that will, hopefully, show the reader the beauty of the land, culture and wildlife of Ladakh as I saw it. </p>
